# Kup-State

KupState provides a way to interface with (but doesn't depend on) Stencil.js generated components.

## Goals

-   Do not depend on any Stencil.js-specific logic
-   Avoid third-party dependencies
-   Unopinionated about the storage backend
-   Prevent tightly-coupled integration
-   Exploit the event-driven nature of javascript to avoid having to deal with DI's
-   Exploit typescript generics and type system to avoid runtime overhead (type checking happens at build-time)
-   Performance oriented (we should add some benchmarks to ensure the overhead is contained as this library evolves)

## TODO

-   [ ] Move this to an appropriate location
-   [ ] Implement redux-persist
-   [ ] Define a way to inject the backend dynamically into KupStateManager
-   [ ] Refactor the code to produce better structured sub-modules
-   [ ] Tests!
