          Hand, was the son of King Terenas Menethil II and heir to the throne.
          He was trained as a paladin by Uther the Lightbringer and was inducted
          into the Order of the Silver Hand. Arthas also had a romantic
          relationship with the kind sorceress Jaina Proudmoore. Committed to
          the protection of his people, Arthas was determined to stop the plague
          spreading throughout Lordaeron. He eventually became the Lich

          >Illidan Stormrage is the first of the demon hunters, the former
          self-proclaimed Lord of Outland, former ruler of the Black Temple, and
          the original leader of the Illidari. He is the twin brother of
          Malfurion Stormrage and was, like his sibling, in love with Tyrande
          Whisperwind. Though born a night elf and renowned as a powerful
          sorcerer, Illidan officially betrayed his people as he temporarily
          sided with the demonic Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients,
          though his reasons for doing so were noble as he secretly aimed to
          repel the Legion's invasion. Due to this betrayal, as well as having
          secretly created a second Well of Eternity after the first one was
          destroyed at the end of the war, he was dubbed "the Betrayer" and
          imprisoned in the Barrow Deeps below Mount Hyjal. There, Illidan
          remained for over 10,000 years, watched over by the warden Maiev
          Shadowsong and her Watchers.</div

          >Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, also referred to as "the Dark Lady" and
          "the Banshee Queen", is the former Warchief of the Horde and former
          supreme ruler of the Forsaken, one of the most powerful factions of
          undead on Azeroth. In life, Sylvanas was the ranger-general of
          Silvermoon, whose leadership acumen and martial prowess were without
          equal. During the Third War, she bravely defended Quel'Thalas from a
          Scourge invasion led by the death knight Arthas Menethil. Ultimately,
          however, Sylvanas fell in battle. Rather than honor the ranger-general
          with a quick death, Arthas ripped out her soul and transformed it into
          a banshee: a cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich King empowered by
          hate.</div
