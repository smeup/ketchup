# ketchup-showcase

## Project setup
See also the readme for the general repository.

Built using Vue CLI, all its intruments are can be used.

To add a package, use npm as if it was a common project not using Lerna.

To be sure that all changes applied into KetchUP components are carried out into the showcase,
being a symlink generated by Lerna, you may want to run the command:
```
lerna bootstrap
```

Before starting the showcase application, since it uses symlinks files that should be ignored when publishing on Git repositories,
but should be published in the npm repository, you must run `npm run build` inside `packages/ketchup`.

This command will force Stencil compiler to build also a few packages needed to load and register
the web components before Vue application is started.

If during development something seems not to be synchronized with the `packages/ketchup` folder, simply re-run `lerna bootstrap`.
